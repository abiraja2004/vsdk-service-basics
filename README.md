# Vault Java SDK Sample - vsdk-service-basics

**Please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/veeva/vsdk-service-basics/wiki) for a detailed walkthrough.**

To help with understanding Vault Java SDK Service interfaces, we created the **vsdk-service-basics** project. We will walk you through running this sample code.

This project contains examples of:

* Query Service
* Record Service
* HTTP Callouts
    * Local 
    * External
    * Vault to Vault

## How to import

Import as a Maven project. This will automatically pull in the required Vault Java SDK dependencies. 

For Intellij this is done by:
- File > Open > Navigate to project folder > Select the 'pom.xml' file > Open as Project

For Eclipse this is done by:
- File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Navigate to project folder > Select the 'pom.xml' file
